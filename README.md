## Functional Responses of Wetland Birds to Human-caused Habitat Degradation and Climate Change: A Case Study from Turkey #
This repository has the R code to reproduce all the analyses and figures for Özgencil *et al*. (2022).

*Corresponding author*: İ. Kaan Özgencil - kaanozgencil@gmail.com

### FOLDER STRUCTURE
Different folders were assigned for taxonomic diversity and functional
diversity analyses, both of which have their own scripts. Each main
folder has within them three subfolders named data, figs, and output.
Data subfolder has data used in the scripts, figs has the figures 
generated and the output file has all other kinds of outputs from the 
code.

### ENVIRONMENT OBJECTS
The environment objects have all the objects generated by the code 
ready to save time for the readers because some of the analyses such
as functional diversity calculations with high numbers of PCoA axes
(i.e., traits) can take a very long time.
